# 🚦 ROI Vehicle Detection App

A Streamlit-based application for detecting and counting vehicles within user-defined regions of interest (ROI) in video files. The app uses YOLO object detection to identify cars, trucks, and buses, and provides real-time traffic congestion analysis.

## 🌟 Features

- **Video Upload**: Support for multiple video formats (MP4, MPV, MOV, AVI, MKV, FLV, WEBM)
- **Interactive ROI Selection**: Draw custom regions of interest using OpenCV interface
- **Real-time Vehicle Detection**: Uses YOLO11 model for accurate vehicle detection
- **Traffic Congestion Analysis**: Customizable thresholds for different vehicle types
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded status indicators (Green = Smooth, Red = Congested)
- **Output Video Generation**: Saves processed video with detection results

### YOLO Model
- The app uses `yolo11m.pt` model file

## 🚀 Installation
### Open pycharm or VS code command prompt
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Obaidhashmi/traffic-detection.git
```
 1.2. **selecting folder**
```
cd traffic-detection
```

2. **Install required packages:**
```bash
pip install streamlit opencv-python numpy ultralytics shapely
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

3. **Run the application:**
```bash
streamlit run roi_selector.py
```

## 💡 Usage

### Step 1: Upload Video
- Launch the Streamlit app
- Upload a video file using the file uploader
- Supported formats: MP4, MPV, MOV, AVI, MKV, FLV, WEBM

### Step 2: Draw ROI Regions
- Click "Select/Draw ROI" button
- A new window will open showing the first frame of your video
- **Drawing Controls:**
  - **Left Click**: Add points to create polygon
  - **Right Click**: Finish current polygon
  - **U Key**: Undo last point
  - **S Key**: Save regions and continue
  - **Q Key**: Quit without saving

### Step 3: Set Detection Thresholds
- Configure vehicle count thresholds:
  - **Car Threshold**: Maximum cars before congestion alert
  - **Truck Threshold**: Maximum trucks before congestion alert  
  - **Bus Threshold**: Maximum buses before congestion alert
  - **Overall Threshold**: Maximum total vehicles before congestion alert

### Step 4: Start Detection
- Click "🚀 Start Vehicle Detection"
- The app will process the video and generate output with:
  - Vehicle count overlay
  - ROI region highlighting
  - Congestion status indicator
  - Real-time statistics

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### regions.json
Stores ROI polygon coordinates and scale factor:
```json
{
  "scale": 1.0,
  "polygons": [
    [
      {"x": 100, "y": 200},
      {"x": 300, "y": 200},
      {"x": 300, "y": 400},
      {"x": 100, "y": 400}
    ]
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Detection Classes

The app detects the following vehicle types:
- **Buse** (Class ID: 0) 
- **Car** (Class ID: 1)
- **Truck** (Class ID: 2)

## 📊 Output

The processed video includes:
- **Statistics Box**: Real-time vehicle counts and thresholds
- **ROI Visualization**: Highlighted regions with color coding
- **Status Indicator**: "Smooth" (Green) or "Congested" (Red)
- **Vehicle Tracking**: Bounding boxes around detected vehicles

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Performance Optimization
- Frame skipping (processes every 4th frame)
- Automatic video scaling for large videos
- Efficient polygon-based ROI checking using Shapely

### Video Processing
- Input: Various video formats
- Output: MP4 format with detection overlay
- FPS: Maintains original video frame rate

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Could not open video" error**
   - Ensure video file is not corrupted
   - Check if video format is supported
   - Verify file permissions

2. **ROI window not opening**
   - Check if video was uploaded successfully
   - Ensure OpenCV is properly installed
   - Try with a different video file

3. **Detection not working**
   - Verify YOLO model is downloaded
   - Check internet connection for model download
   - Ensure regions.json file exists
